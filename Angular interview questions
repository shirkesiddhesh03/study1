1) What is Angular and what is use of it?
-> Angular is a UI binding framework that helps to bind your view with model object.
   It also helps building SPA using the concept of routing, it also has other features like DI, etc.

2) Differecne between AngularJS and Angular
-> first version of angular called Angular JS | later versions are called Angular
   we're using JavaScript | we use TypeScript
   Architecture: Controller based. view has to load first then it load Controller | it is component based, component has template url, it loads HTML/CSS, model basically compoent becomes central point
   not mobile compliant | mobile compliant
   no CLI | CLI
   no Lazy loading | Lazy loading

3) What are directives in Angular?
-> Directives help to attach behaviour to HTML DOM, Directives change the behaviour of HTML DOM
   In simple words we can say it is angular syntax we write in HTML
   Eg. <div>{{value}}</div>
       <div [hidden]= "Hide()"> Hello </div>
   here, value and hidden are directives

4) Explain different type of Angular directives
-> S A C [Structural directives, Attribute directives, Component directives]
   1. Structural directives: these directives change structure of HTML DOM
                             Eg. <tr *ngFor= "let temp of salesArray">
                                    <td>{{temp.customerName}}</td>
                                 </tr>
                                 here. *ngFor directive is responsible for adding new rows ie. changing structure of HTML DOM
   2. Attribute directives: these directives doesn't change the structure but it changes the behaviour of HTML DOM like changing color, appearance, visibility,etc.
                            Eg. <div [hidden]="hide()"> Hello </div>
                                Here, directive hidden is not changing structure like adding or removing html tag but its simply changing the behaviour like hidden
                                or no hidden
   3. Component directives

5) Explain the importance of NPM and Node_Modules folder
-> NPM stands for Node Package Manager. NPM helps to install any JavaScript framework in computer. Eg. npm install jquery
   Once npm install command is hit, specified framework or dependency will be downloaded from gitHub and stored in the folder "Node_Modules"

6) Explain the importance of Package.json
-> All Javascript framework we are using in project are listed in this file so that we can install all packages in one go.

7) What is TypeScript and why do we need it?
-> It is superset of JavaScript. It adds types to JavaScript
   unlike JavaScript, we can specify datatype to variable eg. var a:number
   It gives nice object oriented programming environment which converts to JavaScript.
   command to convert typescript to javaScript-> tsc filename.ts (this command will give filename.js file)

8) Explain importance of Angular CLI
-> Angular CLI is command line interface by which we can create initial Angular project template 

9) Explain importance of compenent and modules
-> Angular is binding framework it binds view and model through component.
   Component is where you write your binding code
   Module logically groups compenents.

10) What is decorator in angular? OR what is annotations? OR what is metadata?
-> Decorator defines what kind of Angular class is it.
   For example, if you decorate class with @Compoenent then it says this class is Angular component
                if you put @NgModule it becomes Angular module
   for our understanding we can say that its kinda annotations

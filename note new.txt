2)What is Interceptor
->
You can use the Interceptor in Spring Boot to perform operations under the following situations −
	- Before sending the request to the controller
	- Before sending the response to the client
For example, you can use an interceptor to add the request header before sending the request to the controller and add the response header before sending the response to the client.
To work with interceptor, you need to create @Component class that supports it and it should implement the HandlerInterceptor interface.
The following are the three methods you should know about while working on Interceptors −
	- preHandle() method − This is used to perform operations before sending the request to the controller. This method should return true to return the response 
                                                                   to the client.
	- postHandle() method − This is used to perform operations before sending the response to the client.
	- afterCompletion() method − This is used to perform operations after completing the request and response.

3) Profiles in spring boot
-> Spring Boot profiles group parts of the application configuration and make it be available only in certain environments
	application-dev.properties
	application-prod.properties
	application.properties
- In "application.properties" We use the "spring.profiles.active" to set active profiles. Eg. spring.profiles.active=local

-> Collections.unmodifiableList(list);
   Collections.unmodifiableSet(set);
   Collections.unmodifiableMap(map);

5) @SpringBootApplication
-> combination of @ComponentScan, @EnableAutoConfiguration and @Confuguration

6) Spring Boot auto-configuration
-> Spring Boot auto-configuration attempts to automatically configure your Spring application based on the jar dependencies that you have added

7) Exception handling in Spring boot
-> 
- The @ControllerAdvice is an annotation, to handle the exceptions globally.
- The @ExceptionHandler is an annotation used to handle the specific exceptions and sending the custom responses to the client.

8) Difference between POST and PUT
->
POST is not idempotent. It is used to create new resource.
PUT is idempotent, meaning calling it once or multiple times successively has the same effect, and it typically replaces the entire resource
PUT's best used when ou are updating or replacing existing data.

18) @Async
-> In Java, the @Async annotation is part of the Spring Framework's concurrency support. When you annotate a method with @Async, Spring will execute that method asynchronously in a separate thread pool. This is particularly useful for offloading tasks that are potentially time-consuming or I/O-bound, allowing the main thread to continue processing other tasks without waiting for the asynchronous method to complete.

Here's how you typically use the @Async annotation:

*1* Enable Async Support:
Before using @Async, you need to enable async support in your Spring application. You can do this by adding the @EnableAsync annotation to a configuration class. 
Eg.
@Configuration
@EnableAsync
public class AppConfig {
    // Other configurations
}

*2* Annotate Methods:
Once async support is enabled, you can annotate methods with @Async to indicate that they should be executed asynchronously.
The method annotated with @Async can have a return type of void, Future<T>, or CompletableFuture<T>, where T is the type of the result returned by the asynchronous method.
Eg. 

@Service
public class MyService {
    @Async
    public CompletableFuture<String> asyncMethod() {
        // Perform asynchronous tasks here
    }
}
